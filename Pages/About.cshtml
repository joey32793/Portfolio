            I'm a Northern California native, born and raised in Redding, California and currently residing in Sacramento. 
            As a blissfully ignorant youth, I loved science, sports, and blazing hot California summers (kind of). After 
            forming a love affair with all things space as a kid, it only seemed to natural to study math and physics at 
            San Diego State University. I graduated in May of 2016 with a degree in Astrophysics, and began crunching 
            numbers in the defense sector of sunny San Diego. After my brief stint in defense, I jumped on I-5 all the way to Sacramento,
            where I currently work as a full stack enterprise software engineer for VSP Global, a vision insurance company.

            I spent my undergrad writing Fortran and the occasional C, where I quickly discovered that while I enjoyed solving
            stellar structure equations (I'm a fan of mass continuity), I far more preferred writing the code
            that solved these problems. I became obsessed with all facets of software development and engineering, aspiring
            to be among the ranks of the best in the world of code. My current work involves developing and maintaining a handful
            Java applications pertaining to optometry practice management, providing production support of all our live software, and
            modernizing legacy applications with the latest technologies like Angular and Spring Boot.

            As a .NET enthusiast, I'm a fan of all things Core nowadays. I prefer building web applications and APIs with .NET Core
            and Angular, with a hint of Django and Node when I'm feeling a little adventurous. My data days working 
            in defense created a secondary passion for database programming, where SQL Server and Postgres are 
            welcome anytime in my projects. As a guy that struggles to draw stick figures, I'm a self-proclaimed Bootstrap
            evangelist as well, dabbling in all things CSS Grid and Angular Flex Layout with a hint of Material Design to breakup 
            the autonomy. I'm an advocate for all things free and open source, and I encourage you to checkout my latest projects on GitHub!
