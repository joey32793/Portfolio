            I'm a Northern California native, born and raised in Redding, California and currently residing in Sacramento. 
            As a blissfully ignorant youth, I loved science, sports, and blazing hot California summers (kind of). After 
            forming a love affair with all things space as a kid, it only seemed to natural to study math and physics at 
            San Diego State University. I graduated in May of 2016 with a degree in Astrophysics, and began crunching 
            numbers in the defense sector of sunny San Diego.

            I spent my undergrad writing Fortran and the occasional C, where I quickly discovered that while I enjoyed solving
            stellar structure equations (I'm a fan of mass continuity), I far more preferred writing the code
            that solved these problems. I became obsessed with all facets of software development and engineering, aspiring
            to be among the ranks of the best in the world of code.

            As a .NET enthusiast, I'm a fan of all things Core nowadays. I prefer building web applications with ASP.NET Core
            and Angular 2+, with a hint of Django when I'm feeling a little adventurous. My data days working 
            in defense created a secondary passion for database programming, where SQL Server, Postgres, and SQLite3 are 
            welcome anytime in my projects. As a guy that struggles to draw stick figures, I'm a self-proclaimed Bootstrap
            evangelist as well.
